// Selected at compile time by platformio.ini:
//   -D BOARD_HEADER='"boards/blackpill_f411ce.h"'
//
// NOTE: the native test environment deliberately builds against THIS header
// too, so `pio test -e native` validates the same parameter/telemetry set the
// real board exposes (that is what keeps test/golden/schema.json honest). The
// pin macros below are never expanded natively, because no driver .cpp is
// compiled there -- only the pure *_params.cpp descriptor files are.

// --- pin map ----------------------------------------------------------------
// Deferred to the Arduino variant's own names (LED_BUILTIN = PC13,
// USER_BTN = PA0) rather than hardcoding pin numbers, so this stays correct
// if the variant is ever revised. A board with no Arduino variant would put
// literal pins here instead -- that indirection is the point of the header.
//
// PC13 *sinks* the on-board LED: driving it LOW turns the LED ON.

#define LED_ACTIVE_LOW  1

// KEY button, pulled up; the driver samples its idle level at boot rather
// than assuming a polarity.
